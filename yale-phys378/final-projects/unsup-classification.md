# An Unsupervised Approach to Classify Astronomical Objects

## Objective
Develop an unsupervised algorithm that separates astronomical objects based on their type (star, galaxy, quasar) 

## Background
Different types of astronomical objects emit different amounts of light at different wavelengths. By observing the same object at different wavelengths (through different filters) or by observing the spectrum of an object, astronomers are able to tell what type an object is. The goal of this project is to develop an unsupervised algorithm that can take as an input the brightness of the object at different wavelengths; and then cluster them according to their type.
