# Predicting Galaxy Flux with ML

## Objective
Develop a machine learning framework that can predict how bright a galaxy is from its image.

## Background 
The flux of a galaxy is an important intrinsic physical property of a galaxy. Astronomers have mostly used light-profile fitting techniques (fitting a 2D model to the image of a galaxy) to determine the flux of galaxies in the past. However, these techniques cannot be scaled to the data-volumes expected in astronomy over the next decade. Therefore, itâ€™s important to develop ML-based frameworks that can determine the flux of galaxies.
