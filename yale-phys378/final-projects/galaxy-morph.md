# Building a Galaxy Morphology Classifier

## Objective
Develop a machine learning framework that can separate disk-dominated galaxies from bulge-dominated galaxies. 

## Background 
The shape of a galaxy encodes different things about the galaxy (e.g., how it has evolved over time, whether it has merged with other galaxies, etc.). Thus determining its shape (referred to as morphology) has important consequences in astronomy. Developing these automated classifiers are extremely crucial in order to power the next decade of data-rich astronomical surveys.
